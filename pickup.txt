# Notes I leave to myself about where I am on programming and work

20170421_1: Mesonet data comparison is now in the program. May add three way
            comparison to the program. Not worrying about station 2 for a bit

20170414_1: Incorporating mesonet data into the program

20170413_2: Oh man.... Weather station 2 has time after Day Light Savings time,
            station 1 is time before DST. So, the same code won't nessacarily
            work with both station data. May need to look and ceck for the last
            data point. If line[3] == 'M': then run a code to convert the time.
            But, if it is BME280, this won't be there to check which station is
            being worked on. Maybe have a CSV item that tell which station it
            is. Alternatively, use UCT instead of local.

20170413_1: WEATHER STATION 2 is functional! Ugly, but functional. Small change
            to functions.py to allow handling of the missing relative humidity
            data - stored as "M" just like ASOS. Will start collecting data
            with it soon. Pressure is absolute, not reduced, so will need
            reduction. Will also need some new menu options so the program
            isn't dumb with the mising humidity data. 

20170411_2: Working on getting the AMS data to play nicely with everything else

20170411_1: Reworked the method of data collection and analysis. All data is
            dumped into master file and then stripped out base on day. This solves the
            problem of partial data due to taking data file in the middle of the day.

20170410_1: Working on stripping data based on date and time. Using something
            like grep YYYYMMDD * | sort > output_YYYYMMDD.txt. Need to learn scripting to
            actually get this done. Think this will be the best method to do it vs trying
            to use a Python program

20170408_2: Created experimental file. Modularized the GUI portion into the
            'menus.py' file.  Should start comparisons soon

20170408_1: Changed times in graph. Added one hour for day light savings time
            change. Changed some graphs to reflect this change. Option in code for non-DST
            time. Should switch to UTC

20170407_2: UPDATING NAMING. Including 'DSM' and 'AMW' in the titles and
            filenames when being saved

20170407_1: Arduino pressure appears to be sea level.... what? How does it know
            height? Arduino sketch updated for 30 second intervals. Starting continuous
            data collection for comparison. Thinking about methods for data analysis

20170406_2: ASOS pressure now is working. Recorded data is way, way off hte sea
            level pressure from the ASOS. Probably an issue with the code...
            Hopefully an issue with the code

20170406_1: Working on getting the ASOS data to plot sea level pressure.
            Functions.py has been upated, need to integrate into
            ASOS_plotting.py and main.py. Compare to sea level reduced pressure
            data from sensor
