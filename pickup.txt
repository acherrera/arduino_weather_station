# Notes I leave to myself about where I am on programming. 

20170410_1: Working on stripping data based on date and time. Using something
like grep YYYYMMDD * | sort > output_YYYYMMDD.txt. Need to learn scripting to
actually get this done. Think this will be the best method to do it vs trying
to use a Python program

20170408_2: Created experimental file. Modularized the GUI portion into the
'menus.py' file.  Should start comparisons soon

20170408_1: Changed times in graph. Added one hour for day light savings time
change. Changed some graphs to reflect this change. Option in code for non-DST
time. Should switch to UTC

20170407_2: UPDATING NAMING. Including 'DSM' and 'AMW' in the titles and
filenames when being saved

20170407_1: Arduino pressure appears to be sea level.... what? How does it know
height? Arduino sketch updated for 30 second intervals. Starting continuous
data collection for comparison. Thinking about methods for data analysis

20170406_2: ASOS pressure now is working. Recorded data is way, way off hte sea
            level pressure from the ASOS. Probably an issue with the code...
            Hopefully an issue with the code

20170406_1: Working on getting the ASOS data to plot sea level pressure.
            Functions.py has been upated, need to integrate into
            ASOS_plotting.py and main.py. Compare to sea level reduced pressure
            data from sensor
