# Arduino Weather Station
Contains files pertaining to the building of a home made weather station. Will be used for a 
school project comparing homemade to professional grade measurements.

# Project Outline
The project can be broken down into two three separate sections. These is the ATMega (Arduino) programming,
the hardware and wiring, and the processing of data. The Arduino programming is done in C; technically a modified C
for Arduino. The data is processed in Python language. 

# Project Notes

## Physical Build issues
Standoff could be much larger. Due to the short size of the stand off,
radiation from the ground is still an issue. Attempting to minimize this by
placing sensor on all objects.

## Things to do
Get more data. Days of data to be analyzed. Keep the data coming in.

Eventually should update sensor to record an average of values instead of
instaneous value. Would make graphs a little better. Can do this on the backend
but it's a little more messy and tends to clutter the code base
