Response files are tested using a refridgerator. Some dataset have the fridge
being opened half way through. This is shown by small spikes in temperature and
coresponding large spikes in RH. 

Method: Record apartment temp ('outside') temperature for a period of time,
place sensor in fridge ('inside') and allow temperature to stabilize. Warming
values appear to be more accurate than cooling values. This is due to large
fluctuations in fridge temperature. Should still be able to accurately
calculate tau regardless of starting and final values. 

NOTE: RH response time should not be considered representative. Very large
response times are due to condensation when going from cool fridge to warm
outside air.
