Station1 is the original station - Arduino Uno powered with BMP280.
Station2 is the text station - Arduino Nano powered with BME180.

Note that each Arduino file has to be in its own seperate folder. This is
something the Arduino IDE enforces

Will assume that all the files here work unless otherwise noted
